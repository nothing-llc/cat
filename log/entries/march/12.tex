today's task: actual \dsp on the pico. we'll try demodulating double-sideband
\am first, then move on to \ssb.

to do the actual \dsp: i've discoved a site,
\href{https://liquidsdr.org/}{https://liquidsdr.org/}, that may be exactly what
we're looking for. it's a \dsp library specifically for embedded-device
{\sdr}s, which\dots\ sounds great, but is difficult to build for the pico. we
may need to reference \autocite{discrete-hilbert} and write something
ourselves\dots

\textit{(later)} wrote code for multiplication with an intermediate frequency
and stubs for proper demodulation, along with a draft of an audio output
interface via \dma. also did some simulations of (double-sideband)
demodulation, so that we have the (preliminary testing) system structure nailed
down. productive day.
