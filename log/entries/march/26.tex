took a break over break (from this, at least).

today: \am demodulation. getting audio out synched with data in is
\emph{tricky}; turns out the frequencies are not carefully controlled enough
for it to ``just work,'' so i had to pull some magic \dma stuff. in the end, we
got simple \am demodulation code working, though it's noisy and we don't really
have an \textsc{if} set in the pico yet.

\emph{to do:} somehow make the intermediate frequency more stable; there seems
to be a phase jump each time we loop around the buffer. maybe enter the buffer
at a different point in the cycle each time? we'll see.
