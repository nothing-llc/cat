back to the pico today! i'll be working with evan to get a proper dev
environment set up, as well as perhaps doing \dsp to extract a signal.

implemented double-buffering for \adc reading -- basically, we read to one
buffer while doing \dsp from the other buffer. for a simple averaging
calculation, this leaves 500 \textmu s spare time for a 1.3 ms loop time. we
should be able to pull this off!
