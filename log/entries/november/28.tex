back to the phase shifter today. really want to get this thing working before
the end of the semester. probe impedance seems to matter a distressing amount
for performance â€”- a 100x probe measures a full 20\textdegree\ more shift.

tried an integrator instead\ldots\ and that was \emph{really} easy to tune and
worked nearly immediately. guess we're using that!
