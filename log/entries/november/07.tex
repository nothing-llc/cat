finally building today! using the \textsc{cd74hc4046ae} as a \pll building
block to start with, with the capacitor/resistor values given in the datasheet
for the \vco, powered with a 5 V supply. with 2.5 V applied to the \vco's
control terminal, the output frequency (for our chip) was around 14.7 MHz.
managed to achieve phase lock to a 10 MHz oscillator using the chip's
\textsc{pc3 out} pin and a variable capacitor in the \vco, so this can be done
but is not yet stable.

a very stable lock is achievable around 350 kHz center frequency! apparently we
just need to lower the freq. of the phase comparator, etc. adding a few
\textsc{74ls163} dividers allowed synthesis of a (relatively) stable 14 MHz
signal from an input around 440 kHz. next step is to try this \pll with a
teensy's \pwm output setting the reference frequency.

\ldots and it works! we now have a digitally-controlled \pll.
