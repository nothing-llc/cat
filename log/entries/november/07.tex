finally building today! using the \textsc{cd74hc4046ae} as a \pll building
block to start with, with the capacitor/resistor values given in the datasheet
for the \vco, powered with a 5 V supply. with 2.5 V applied to the \vco's
control terminal, the output frequency (for our chip) was around 14.7 MHz.
