went back to the teensy \pll today. goal is to get the thing soldered, and
maybe have a mixer on the other end of it for \dsb up/downconversion. started
reading chapter 5 in \autocite{experimental-rf} for ideas on how to implement
this.

\textit{an aside:} just had an interesting idea for a precision variable
oscillator over a narrow range. use two quadrature oscillators, one around the
center frequency and one at a lower frequency off a straight-divide \pll, then
basically \ssb modulate to produce a reference frequency. would be sort of
crazy, but if it works\ldots
