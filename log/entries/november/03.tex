worked on the technical writing today, which involved doing further research
into \ssb modulation schemes. actually worked out the math for weaver, finally
-- details may be found in the tech writing itself. weaver modulation seems the
best way to proceed with \ssb, and the octave code is working now, so we're all
set to build!
