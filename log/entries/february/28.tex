porting to the pico today, as best we can. platformio does not seem to like the
pico, so we'll be running using \verb`picotool` (most likely) and the pico c++
sdk.

\textit{update later:} works brilliantly! i'm using direct memory access for
\spi data transfer so that the processor is not hung while doing data
acquisition. we'll have two free cores for \dsp, after all!
