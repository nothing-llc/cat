back to the \pll today; apparently j saw a \emph{lot} of spectral spread on the
output and i want to track it down. it seems that the teensy \emph{itself} has
similar spread, so we may have to use a different clock source\dots

re-checked with the scope's function generator -- and the teensy -- and we have
peaks 20 dB down and pretty far away, so maybe this isn't an issue? the teensy
seems capable of producing an 800 kHz signal, so we can at least decrease the
division ratio to 16 (which pushes the adjacent peaks further away).

discovered something interesting while fucking around with the \pll settings
for the teensy: there's a limited granularity of about 70 kHz! that's really
too wide for our tastes, so we may have to use a frequency synth controlled via
\spi.
