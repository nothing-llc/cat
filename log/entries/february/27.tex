due to illness, life stuff, etc., been out of the loop for a while. today's
task: thomas \amp i read data from an \adc. we'll be using the \textsc{ad7478}
from analog devices.

reading from the \adc turned out to be quite easy -- the \spi interface worked
nearly first try. to do:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item read really fast. maybe process a large buffer of \spi data at
	once.
	\item see about using data-out from the teensy as the chip select pin
	for speed.
\end{enumerate}

after some more investigation: async \spi doesn't seem to be feasible. we'll
try a pico next.
