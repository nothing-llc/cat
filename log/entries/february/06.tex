finally back at work after start-of-semester slog and being sick for a week.
yay! today's task is strengthening the output of the \pll (discovered that the
added capacitance of a 1x probe wound up distorting the waveform). maybe i'll
make it a nice clean sine wave while i'm at it?

discovered an interesting voltage follower architecture with local feedback
\autocite{flipped-follower} and would like to try it.
