several events occurred before this log started properly:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the group met a few times and worked out the general structure of
	the project. we decided to use a modular framework (i.e., many
	semi-independent blocks wired together) so that we could more easily
	divide the work and test it. this method will also give us experience
	with designing to specifications, as we'll be working concurrently on
	parts that have to work together in the end.

	\item evan, jin wook, and i spoke to prof. koo about potentially
	consulting him on project design matters, and he was quite amiable. the
	three of us are also doing an independent study in antenna design with
	him --- don't worry, we'll keep the antennas there and the transceivers
	here, but the projects will certainly inform each other!

	\item i set up a git organization for us, as well as an overleaf
	account that we'll share, for document and project file storage
	purposes.
\end{enumerate}
i think that's it; not a whole lot has happened yet, as it's really the
beginning of the project. more to come!
