\subsection*{sourcing}
finalized the parts order today, and talked about circuit design and
integration. our plan is to order a few \lna s, some \pll chips (with
dividers), and a few ring modulators. these should serve us to at least
synthesize and demodulate \fm signals.

\subsection*{research}
jin wook spoke to prof. hakner and discovered that most people in the 20 m band
use \ssb \am rather than \fm, so we may integrate \am capabilities for voice
and \fm for digital transmission. he also found a schematic for an existing
radio, which we will likely use for experimentation. i mention this because i
may attempt to build a \ssb modulator in the near future.

short entry this time, as it's from memory. sorry.
