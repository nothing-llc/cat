\subsection*{planning}
the group and i discussed our plans for initial research; included is jin
wook's summary of such (quoted):

	We decided to look at the RF receiver block first (and then progress to
	the IF stage). Instead of looking at chips that have combined
	functionality, we chose to assign each "block" to each member and spend
	this week exploring what chips \& circuits are good for each block. (We
	decided to push back on the antenna block for later.)

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Catherine is looking at the local oscillator block,
		\item Evan is looking at the RF filter block,
		\item Jeongwoo we've assigned you the LNA block,
		\item I will be looking at the mixer block,
		\item Thomas we've assigned you to begin looking into the
		subsequent IF stage (for example, IF high-Q filter).
	\end{itemize}

i had a few other pressing concerns over the weekend, so i knew i would be
running late on my part. updates to come\ldots\ later.
