i assembled a simple ring modulator mockup in ltspice, which served to
illustrate the basic mechanics of making one. the difficulties in using a ring
modulator for direct upconversion is the input inductance and frequency -- the
modulating signal is coupled in through a transformer, which must operate both
at \rf and \ifreq.
