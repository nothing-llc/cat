returned to the problem of the hilbert transformer and kept simulating \amp
programming. razavi, once again, has the answer! if we upconvert the original
signal, then put it through an \emph{approximate} \(\pi/2\) phase shift, we'll
get out what is very nearly a hilbert transform of the original! this \emph{is}
the hartley architecture -- thank goodness he actually stated it!

\ldots assuming i correctly understand how it works, that is.
