i think we're finally getting towards finished hardware!

today is \textsc{if} amp work, because that's the last part that's being
persnickety. we need somewhere between 60 and 120 dB gain from the \lna to the
\adc, and we're doing our darnedest to get that. i made a preliminary design
that might get us close, but it's dependent on a lot of uncertain factors --
we'll have to see how it goes in real life.

	kHz.}

came up with a second draft, basically the same but with one fewer transistor.

\end{figure}

ok. that was one thing for today. the other was supply stabilization: i found
~10 mV of noise at the output of our lab supplies, which caused the distortion
j and evan saw at the output of the \lna. filtered it out with about 50 \textmu
H of inductance in series with both sides of the supply, along with a few
capacitors; this cleaned up the \lna beautifully, leaving nearly 20 dB of gain
past the band-pass \rf filter. i have a great deal more respect for radio power
supplies now!
