today: \lna testing with j. was on a call with j and jin wook over the weekend
to debug the commercial model, as it was oscillating. we haven't solved that
and so are going to make a simple one of our own (just two transistors).

update: works! just had to work out some bugs in j's design. we have about 28
dB gain with the \lna and initial \rf filter cascaded, which should be enough!
on to debugging the \textsc{if} amp.
